An ASPNET web application to send emails in google

**How to run program:**

- Run in Visual Studio

**How it works:**

- The code works by having the sender (google) account enabled their `2-step Verification.` (This can be found in the *myaccount.google.com* under, security settings)
- If the `2-step Verification` is enabled then the `App Password` section will show. 
- Click `App Password` and login.
- `Select app > Other (custom name)` label your usage for that password.
